DIVE: Diversity-Informed Valuation of Ecosystem functioning
an algorithmic reductionist framework that connects microbiome structure with ecosystem functioning through cross-correlation analysis. 
DIVE calculates the cross-correlation between two variablesâ€”biodiversity as indicated by the varying alpha diversity metrics and ecosystem functioning
as defined by the user.
The alpha-diversity metric that correlated most significantly with the ecosystem functioning measure is attributed to the microbiome structure that most effectively
enhances the ecosystem functioning.
